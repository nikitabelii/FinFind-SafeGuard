## How it works
An underwater camera, deployed in the coastal waters near a popular beach, serves as a vigilant guardian against potential shark threats. This camera is equipped with technology designed to identify sharks with remarkable accuracy. At the heart of this system is a pre-trained AlexNet model, a type of convolutional neural network renowned for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. AlexNet has been trained on a vast dataset of underwater images, enabling it to distinguish sharks. When the camera spots a shark in the beach water, it participates in ensuring public safety by sending an immediate alert to the nearby lifeguard. This message empowers the lifeguard to swiftly take action, warning people on the beach of the danger and potentially preventing dangerous encounters between humans and sharks.

## Why is it important

**Protecting Human Lives:**

The most obvious importance is the protection of human lives. Shark attacks can be serious or even fatal. The program esures the safety of beachgoers, swimmers, surfers, and divers.

**Reducing Fear and Anxiety:**

The fear of shark attacks can deter people from enjoying the ocean. Effective safety measures can reduce this fear and anxiety, encouraging more people to engage in beach and ocean activities.

**Supporting Local Economies and Tourism:**

Coastal areas, like Florida, often rely heavily on tourism. Fear of shark attacks can negatively impact these economies. By ensuring public safety, localities can maintain a thriving tourist industry. Safe beaches attract more visitors, which benefits hotels, restaurants, and other businesses in coastal areas.

## Conclusion
FinFind Safeguard technology represents a significant advancement in beach safety and tourist experience, offering a comprehensive solution for public beaches and tourist destinations.

# AlexNet
[AlexNet](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v3CwUUp9sjcOkj0G-Ulp8g6gt3dwEkZG?usp=sharing) is a convolutional neural network (CNN) used for image recognition tasks. It works by processing input images through multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. These layers extract and learn hierarchical features from the images, enabling the model to classify images into different categories effectively.
