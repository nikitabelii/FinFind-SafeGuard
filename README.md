## Problem 
Shark attacks on humans still happen today. And when they happen, they can result in serious injuries or fatalities. 

## Overview
FinFind Safeguard is an innovative technology that ensures public beach safety by recognizing sharks in water.

## How it works

<img src= "https://github.com/nikitabelii/FinFind-SafeGuard/assets/143030719/9a0cf732-ac1e-41f0-a1ec-eb313031f9f4" alt="image_description" width="800">

An underwater camera, deployed in the coastal waters near a popular beach, serves as a vigilant guardian against potential shark threats. This camera is equipped with technology designed to identify sharks with remarkable accuracy.

When the camera spots a shark in the beach water, it participates in ensuring public safety by sending an immediate alert to the nearby lifeguard. This message empowers the lifeguard to swiftly take action, warning people on the beach of the danger and potentially preventing dangerous encounters between humans and sharks.

# AlexNet
At the heart of this system is a pre-trained [AlexNet](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v3CwUUp9sjcOkj0G-Ulp8g6gt3dwEkZG?usp=sharing) model, a type of convolutional neural network used for image recognition tasks.

AlexNet works by processing input images through multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. These layers extract and learn features from the images, enabling the model to classify images into different categories effectively.

[ All Data Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GCEIlXu9bqusEShnHxgG5mU2u6IF6JgzBkYBzqsDLYo/edit?usp=sharing)

It has been trained on a vast dataset of underwater images, enabling it to distinguish sharks.

# Filters

Filters are small learnable matrices used to perform convolution operations on the input image. Each filter is responsible for detecting a specific type of feature, such as edges, textures, or more complex patterns.

# Feature Maps

Feature maps are the result of applying filters to the input image using the convolution operation. Each filter generates one feature map. The feature map highlights areas of the input image where the filter's pattern or feature is present

Stacking multiple convolutional layers with different filters allows AlexNet to progressively learn and represent features from simple to more complex in a step-by-step manner. This helps in improving the network's ability to recognize objects and patterns in images.

# Why is it important

**Protecting Human Lives:**

The most obvious importance is the protection of human lives. Shark attacks can be serious or even fatal. The program esures the safety of beachgoers, swimmers, surfers, and divers.

**Reducing Fear and Anxiety:**

The fear of shark attacks can deter people from enjoying the ocean. Effective safety measures can reduce this fear and anxiety, encouraging more people to engage in beach and ocean activities.

**Supporting Local Economies and Tourism:**

Coastal areas, like Florida, often rely heavily on tourism. Fear of shark attacks can negatively impact these economies. By ensuring public safety, localities can maintain a thriving tourist industry. Safe beaches attract more visitors, which benefits hotels, restaurants, and other businesses in coastal areas.
